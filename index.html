        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Beyond coding, I find joy in the rhythm of shuttlecocks and strings. Whether engaging in a spirited
          badminton match or strumming melodies on the guitar, these leisure pursuits provide a perfect balance.

          personal and professional life.
        <br>
